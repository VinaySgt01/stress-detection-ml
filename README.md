# Stress Detection Using Machine Learning

This project uses a dataset of physiological and psychological indicators to detect stress using machine learning algorithms. It was developed as part of a college assignment.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset `stress.csv` contains labeled data used to train a classifier to detect stress levels.

## 🧠 Model

This project demonstrates:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model building and evaluation using scikit-learn

## 📁 Files

- `stress_detection.ipynb`: Main notebook containing code and outputs.
- `stress.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the model.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stress-detection-ml.git
   cd stress-detection-ml

   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook stress_detection.ipynb

   
## 📈 Model Accuracy and Results

The final model achieved:

- ✅ Accuracy: 92.7%
- ✅ Precision: 91.3%
- ✅ Recall: 93.1%
- ✅ F1 Score: 92.2%

A confusion matrix and ROC curve were also plotted to evaluate the model performance.

## 📉 Limitations and Future Work

- Data is limited and may not generalize to all stress indicators.
- Feature selection can be improved with more domain knowledge.
- In the future, deep learning techniques or wearable device data can enhance the model.
## 🖼 Sample Output Visuals
